# Heart-Disease-Prediction-A-Machine-Learning-Approach

This project aims to use various machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on clinical and physiological features. The goal is to provide insights that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions.

Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following packages:

NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
seaborn

The dataset used (heart.csv) contains several clinical and physiological features that are commonly assessed in individuals suspected of having heart disease. The notebook begins by loading and examining this data for preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

The notebook outlines the steps taken from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare data for analysis by handling missing values and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize distributions and correlations between features.
Model Training: Apply machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, and random forests to train predictive models.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your enhancements.
